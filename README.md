# Protein Analyzer script using C
This is a simple script that read a (pdb) file that contains information about protein atoms
(e.g. [2g4j.pdb](https://github.com/KareemAbbasi/C-ex1/blob/master/2g4j.pdb), [6lyz.pdb](https://github.com/KareemAbbasi/C-ex1/blob/master/6lyz.pdb)),
and then finds the following information:
- Center of gravity.
- Orbital Radius.
- Max distance between two atoms.

# Files
1. AnalyzeProtein.c - The script that does all the work. Receives as arguments the pdb files
and outputs the results for each one.
2. 2g4j.pdb, 6lyz.pdb example files.
